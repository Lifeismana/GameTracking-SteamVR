%s %s %s: called with enabled robustBufferAccess. Use robustBufferAccess as a debugging tool during development. Enabling it causes loss in performance for accesses to uniform buffers and shader storage buffers. Disable robustBufferAccess in release builds. Only leave it enabled if the application use-case requires the additional level of reliability due to the use of unverified user-supplied draw parameters.
%s %s A second pipeline cache is in use. Consider using only one pipeline cache to improve cache hit rate.
%s %s Don't issue read-to-read barriers. Get the resource in the right state the first time you use it.
%s %s High number of VkFence objects created.Minimize the amount of CPU-GPU synchronization that is used. Semaphores and fences have overhead. Each fence has a CPU and GPU cost with it.
%s %s High number of vkSemaphore objects created. Minimize the amount of queue synchronization that is used. Semaphores and fences have overhead. Each fence has a CPU and GPU cost with it.
%s %s Pipeline %s was bound twice in the frame. Keep pipeline state changes to a minimum, for example, by sorting draw calls by pipeline.
%s %s Subresource (arrayLayer: %u, mipLevel: %u) of image was cleared as part of LOAD_OP_CLEAR, but last time image was used, it was written to with STORE_OP_STORE. Storing to the image is probably redundant in this case, and wastes bandwidth on tile-based architectures.
%s %s Subresource (arrayLayer: %u, mipLevel: %u) of image was cleared as part of LOAD_OP_CLEAR, but last time image was used, it was written to with vkCmdClear*Image(). Clearing the image with vkCmdClear*Image() is probably redundant in this case, and wastes bandwidth on tile-based architectures.
%s %s Subresource (arrayLayer: %u, mipLevel: %u) of image was loaded to tile as part of LOAD_OP_LOAD, but last time image was used, it was written to with %s. %s
%s %s Trying to create a multisampled image, but pCreateInfo->usage did not have VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT set. Multisampled images may be resolved on-chip, and do not need to be backed by physical storage. TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT allows tiled GPUs to not back the multisampled image with physical memory.
%s %s command buffers submitted %d times this frame. Submitting command buffers has a CPU and GPU overhead. Submit fewer times to incur less overhead.
%s %s operation following %s without intervening execution barrier, is a race condition and may result in data hazards.
%s %s operation following %s without intervening execution barrier, may cause race condition. %s
%s %s operation following %s without intervening vkCmdResetEvent, may result in data hazard and is ignored.
%s %s queue ownership of %s (%s), from srcQueueFamilyIndex %u to dstQueueFamilyIndex %u duplicates existing barrier submitted in this batch from %s.
%s %s: Attachment #%u in render pass has begun with VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_LOAD.\nSubmitting this renderpass will cause the driver to inject a readback of the attachment which will copy in total %u pixels (renderArea = { %s }) to the tile buffer.
%s %s: Depth pre-passes may be in use. In general, this is not recommended in tile-based deferred renderering architectures; such as those in Arm Mali or PowerVR GPUs. Since they can remove geometry hidden by other opaque geometry. Mali has Forward Pixel Killing (FPK), PowerVR has Hiden Surface Remover (HSR) in which case, using depth pre-passes for hidden surface removal may worsen performance.
%s %s: Render pass was ended, but attachment #%u (format: %u, untouched aspects 0x%x) was never accessed by a pipeline or clear command. On tile-based architectures, LOAD_OP_LOAD and STORE_OP_STORE consume bandwidth and should not be part of the render pass if the attachments are not intended to be accessed.
%s %s: The command buffer contains many small indexed drawcalls (at least %u drawcalls with less than %u indices each). This may cause pipeline bubbles. You can try batching drawcalls or instancing when applicable.
%s (%u) is different from %s (%u).
%s A second pipeline cache is in use. Consider using only one pipeline cache to improve cache hit rate
%s Attempting to resolve a multisampled image. This is a very slow and extremely bandwidth intensive path. You should always resolve multisampled images on-tile with pResolveAttachments in VkRenderPass.
%s Avoid switching between pipelines with and without tessellation, geometry, task, and/or mesh shaders. Group draw calls using these shader stages together.
%s Clearing image with format %s without a 1.0f or 0.0f clear color. The clear will not get compressed in the GPU, harming performance. This can be fixed using a clear color of VkClearColorValue{0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}, or VkClearColorValue{1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}. Alternatively, use %s.
%s Clearing image with unregistered VkClearColorValue{%s}. This clear will not get compressed in the GPU, harming performance. The clear color is not registered because too many unique colors have been used. Select a discrete set of clear colors and stick to those. VkClearColorValue{0, 0, 0, 0} and VkClearColorValue{1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f} are always registered.
%s Consider using combined image samplers instead of separate samplers for marginally better performance.
%s Creating a sampler object with LOD bias != 0.0 (%f). This will lead to less efficient descriptors being created and may cause reduced performance.
%s Creating a sampler object with LOD clamping (minLod = %f, maxLod = %f). This may cause reduced performance. Instead of clamping LOD in the sampler, consider using an VkImageView which restricts the mip-levels, set minLod to 0.0, and maxLod to VK_LOD_CLAMP_NONE.
%s Creating a sampler object with anisotropy. This will lead to less efficient descriptors being created and may cause reduced performance.
%s Creating a sampler object with border clamping and borderColor != VK_BORDER_COLOR_FLOAT_TRANSPARENT_BLACK. This will lead to less efficient descriptors being created and may cause reduced performance. If possible, use VK_BORDER_COLOR_FLOAT_TRANSPARENT_BLACK as the border color.
%s Creating a sampler object with unnormalized coordinates. This will lead to less efficient descriptors being created and may cause reduced performance.
%s Creating a sampler object with wrapping modes which do not match (U = %u, V = %u, W = %u). This may cause reduced performance even if only U (1D image) or U/V wrapping modes (2D image) are actually used. If you need different wrapping modes, disregard this warning.
%s Depth attachment %s is primarily rendered with depth compare op %s, but some draws use %s. Z-cull is disabled for the least used direction, which harms depth testing performance. The Z-cull direction can be reset by clearing the depth attachment, transitioning from VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED, using VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE, or using VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_DONT_CARE.
%s Descriptor set memory was allocated via vkAllocateDescriptorSets() for sets which were previously freed in the same logical device. On some drivers or architectures it may be most optimal to re-use existing descriptor sets.
%s Dynamic States usage incurs a performance cost. Ensure that they are truly needed
%s In this frame, %u barriers were already submitted. Barriers have a high cost and can stall the GPU. Consider consolidating and re-organizing the frame to use fewer barriers.
%s Pipeline is multisampled and color attachment #%u makes use of a format which cannot be blended at full throughput when using MSAA.
%s Pipeline layout size is too large, prefer using pipeline-specific descriptor set layouts. Aim for consuming less than %u bytes to allow fast reads for all non-bindless descriptors. Samplers, textures, texel buffers, and combined image samplers consume 4 bytes each. Uniform buffers and acceleration structures consume 8 bytes. Storage buffers consume 16 bytes. Push constants do not consume space.
%s Prefer building acceleration structures on an asynchronous compute queue, instead of using the universal graphics queue.
%s Reuse memory allocations instead of releasing and reallocating. A memory allocation has been released %u.%03u seconds ago, and it could have been reused in place of this allocation.
%s Reuse memory allocations instead of releasing and reallocating. A memory allocation has just been released, and it could have been reused in place of this allocation.
%s Swapchain is not being created with presentation mode "VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR". Prefer using "VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR" to avoid unnecessary CPU and GPU load and save power. Presentation modes which are not FIFO will present the latest available frame and discard other frame(s) if any.
%s The indices which were specified for the draw call are estimated to cause thrashing of the post-transform vertex cache, with a hit-rate of %.02f%%. I.e. the ordering of the index buffer may not make optimal use of indices associated with recently shaded vertices.
%s The indices which were specified for the draw call only utilise approximately %.02f%% of index buffer value range. Arm Mali architectures before G71 do not have IDVS (Index-Driven Vertex Shading), meaning all vertices corresponding to indices between the minimum and maximum would be loaded, and possibly shaded, whether or not they are used.
%s The indices which were specified for the draw call only utilise approximately %.02f%% of the bound vertex buffer.
%s This vkCreateGraphicsPipelines call is created with depthBiasEnable set to true and both depthBiasConstantFactor and depthBiasSlopeFactor are set to 0. This can cause reduced efficiency during rasterization. Consider disabling depthBias or increasing either depthBiasConstantFactor or depthBiasSlopeFactor.

A FunctionCall must happen within a function body.
A Swapchain is being created which specifies a sharing mode of VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE while specifying multiple queues (queueFamilyIndexCount of %u).
A Swapchain is being created with minImageCount set to %u, which means double buffering is going to be used. Using double buffering and vsync locks rendering to an integer fraction of the vsync rate. In turn, reducing the performance of the application if rendering is slower than vsync. Consider setting minImageCount to 3 to use triple buffering to maximize performance in such cases.

Attachment %u in VkFramebuffer uses loadOp/storeOps which need to access physical memory, but the image backing the image view has VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT set. Physical memory will need to be backed lazily to this image, potentially causing stalls.
Attachment %u in VkFramebuffer uses loadOp/storeOps which never have to be backed by physical memory, but the image backing the image view does not have VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT set. You can save physical memory by using transient attachment backed by lazily allocated memory here.
Attachment %u in the VkRenderPass has the format %s and is used as a resolve attachment, but VkSubpassResolvePerformanceQueryEXT::optimal is VK_FALSE.
Attachment %u in the VkRenderPass is a multisampled image with %u samples, but it uses loadOp/storeOp which requires accessing data from memory. Multisampled images should always be loadOp = CLEAR or DONT_CARE, storeOp = DONT_CARE. This allows the implementation to use lazily allocated memory effectively.

Vertex Count must be a 32-bit unsigned int scalar
Vertex attribute at location %u not consumed by vertex shader.
Vertex binding %u is VK_NULL_HANDLE. (Most likely you forgot to call vkCmdBindVertexBuffers)
Vertex binding %u is not a valid VkBuffer. (Check the buffer set in vkCmdBindVertexBuffers)
Vertex buffers was bound to %s but no draws had a pipeline that used the vertex buffer.
Vertex shader %s is bound, but %s.
Vertex shader uses input at location %u, but it was not provided with vkCmdSetVertexInputEXT().
