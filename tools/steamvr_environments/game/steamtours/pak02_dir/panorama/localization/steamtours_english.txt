		"Mars_ApproachTitle"		"Approach"
		"Mars_ApproachDesc"			"The Curiosity rover reached this region in the autumn of 2014, before spending more than a year circling the area you are exploring - getting an overview before more thoroughly investigating geological features of particular scientific interest."

		"Mars_ArtisticLicenceTitle"	"Artistic Licence"
		"Mars_ArtisticLicenceDesc"	"While this is a visualisation of real data, some liberties have been taken - to start, colour is artificial, since the source navigation  camera images were monochrome. The sky is procedurally generated, using images of Martian clouds as reference. The distant mountain and crater rim are placed by eye - sufficiently high-resolution data for the whole terrain was not available."
		
		"Mars_BookCliffsTitle"		"Book Cliffs"
		"Mars_BookCliffsDesc"		"Features on Mars can be given unexpected names - such as these 'cliffs' just centimeters high. One of a number of outcrops showing ancient sedimentary layers, the rover drilled, sampled and intensively analyzed these rocks, sending back data to scientists on Earth."
		
		"Mars_CuriosityTitle"		"Mars Science Laboratory: Curiosity"
		"Mars_CuriosityDesc"		"Curiosity is a 900kg, nuclear-powered robot that has been exploring the surface of Mars since August 2012. The terrain you see around you is constructed from images sent back from its navigation cameras, shown at true-to-life scale."
		
		"Mars_DunesTitle"			"Dunes"
		"Mars_DunesDesc"			"The surface atmospheric pressure on Mars is typically around 0.6% that on Earth. This atmosphere, mostly comprised of carbon dioxide, may be extremely thin - but its winds are still enough to form these sand dunes from the fine Martian dust."
		
		"Mars_ExitTitle"			"Exit"
		"Mars_ExitDesc"				"The rover left this region in early 2015. Moving at a typical top speed of just 30 metres per hour, it was already close to completing its first ten kilometres."
		
		"Mars_ImageGlitchesTitle"	"Image Glitches"
		"Mars_ImageGlitchesDesc"	"The 3D terrain model shown here was built from close to a thousand monochrome navigation camera images from the Mars rover. If there are holes or patches of blurriness in what you see, it is because we have no better aligned NAVCAM data to describe that area."
		
		"Mars_MountSharpTitle"		"View to Mount Sharp"
		"Mars_MountSharpDesc"		"Officially named Aeolis Mons, this mountain rises 5.5km above the northern floor of the surrounding 154km-diameter Gale crater."

		"Mars_OpenDataTitle"		"Open Data"
		"Mars_OpenDataDesc"		"This scene was built using Mars rover imagery released to the general public by NASA and JPL - huge thanks to these organisations for making such things as this virtual reality reconstruction possible!"
		
		"Mars_OverviewTitle"		"Pahrump Hills, Gale Crater, Mars: Sols 753-903"
		"Mars_OverviewDesc"			"From around Sep 18, 2014 to Feb 20, 2015, the Curiosity rover explored this region of the Gale Crater on Mars. This scene was built from images the rover took during this time.\n\nSource imagery: NASA / JPL-Caltech / MSSS"
		
		"Mars_WhaleRockTitle"		"Whale Rock"
		"Mars_WhaleRockDesc"		"This rocky outcrop shows cross-bedding, resulting from water passing over a loose bed of sediment. These layers are thought to have formed over three billion years ago around an ancient lake, and have slowly been exposed again by erosion."
		
		"EnglishChurch_OverviewTitle" "Scanning the Real World for VR"
		"EnglishChurch_OverviewDesc" "This scene of a Derbyshire churchyard was produced using a process called photogrammetry, which involves taking many digital photos from different positions and angles before running them through specialised software."
		
		"EnglishChurch_CaptureTitle"	"Capture"
		"EnglishChurch_CaptureDesc"	"This scene was captured in early January 2016 in a brief gap between winter storms. It was built from around 450 photos taken over the period of half an hour. To capture the sunlight, shadows and ambience of the moment, one must shoot quickly."
		
		"EnglishChurch_ExposureTitle"	"Camera"
		"EnglishChurch_ExposureDesc"	"A digital SLR and two camera lenses were used for this capture – a general-purpose wide angle lens and a super-wide lens for extra coverage. The same manual exposure settings were used throughout the environment to ensure consistent lighting in the final 3D model."
			
		"EnglishChurch_NotHDR2Title"	"Shadows"
		"EnglishChurch_NotHDR2Desc"		"Make the most of dynamic range in your photos. Eye adaptation in the VR headset is quite impressive – shadowed sections that look too dark on a monitor tend to render excellently in the headset."
		
		"EnglishChurch_ViewDirectionTitle"	"View Direction"
		"EnglishChurch_ViewDirectionDesc"	"Due to the preceding storms, the road and grass were very damp – vigorously reflecting the low, winter sun. This view-dependent reflectivity led to some blotchiness in the lighting, which was partly cleaned up in Photoshop. The sun shining directly into the camera lens was another issue."
		
		"EnglishChurch_GeometryTitle"	"Geometry and Texturing"
		"EnglishChurch_GeometryDesc"	"This scene was built using a combination of Reality Capture and Agisoft PhotoScan. After taking many digital photos, these programs were used to calculate a 3D model and create a texture (which colours the model) before bringing it into the workshop tools."
		
		"EnglishChurch_VegetationTitle"	"Vegetation"
		"EnglishChurch_VegetationDesc"	"The trees above were done by projecting photos on to a rough reconstruction of the foliage, then effectively chroma-keying out the blue sky in Photoshop (similar principle to using a green screen)."

		"EnglishChurch_SkydomeTitle"	"Skydome"
		"EnglishChurch_SkydomeDesc"		"Several hundred metres out, the skydome is mostly from photos around the edges, blending to gradients for the zenith (done in Photoshop); the blue sky made this much easier. Faint noise was added to reduce banding – this must be done carefully, to avoid it coming across as a dome."
		
		"EnglishChurch_CleanupTitle"	"Cleanup"
		"EnglishChurch_CleanupDesc"		"For the most part, this scene is made up of scanned geometry, calculated by Reality Capture. In addition, some cleanup was done – unnecessary geometry was trimmed away, holes were filled in, and some melted gravestones were rebuilt. Distant buildings are remodeled, tracing around the rough, gappy scanned model."
		
		"EnglishChurch_StatisticsTitle"	"Statistics"
		"EnglishChurch_StatisticsDesc"	"The mesh is around two million triangles, using 14 8k-square textures – 12 colour-only for scanned geometry, one colour-only for distant buildings and the skydome, and one colour-and-alpha for trees and other part-transparent vegetation."

		
		"EnglishChurch_CameraPositionsTitle"	"Camera Positions"
		"EnglishChurch_CameraPositionsDesc"		"Navigation in VR is mostly limited to where photos were taken from – the grass was really wet, so care was taken not to wander too much from the paths. As a result, camera positions are not ideal – the reconstruction gets rougher the further you get from these navigable areas."

In our work, we really value face to face collaboration so we built our offices to support that. As you look around, you may notice the gifts from the community, awards we’ve won, and items related to our games and hardware products. Take a look around and let us know what you think. We’ve been giving tours of our real-world offices to fans for years, so if you find yourself in Seattle someday, please come by and say hello.\n"

		"ValveLobby_AegisTitle"	"The Aegis of Champions"
		"ValveLobby_AegisDesc"	"When we started working with Icefrog on Dota 2, it was clear that we had an interesting challenge: how do we show Dota 1's enormous playerbase that they could trust us to be good stewards of their beloved game? \n\nWe wanted to show them that we took it as seriously as they did, which led us to launching Dota 2 by unveiling The International Dota 2 tournament, an annual event where we bring the top Dota 2 teams from around the world to compete for the Aegis you see here. \n\nWeta Workshop helped build this trophy out of cold cast bronze & electroplated silver.  Each year the names of The International winners are added to the inscription on its back.\n"
		
		"ValveLobby_InjectionMouldsTitle"	"Steam Controller Mold"
		"ValveLobby_InjectionMouldsDesc"	"This is a prototype injection mold set for the Steam Controller. It's a proto-mold, used for creating a small volume of testing units. In this case, it was used to create 200 units of the Gordon version of the controller, a version that was being tested about a year before the controller's release in November 2015. \n\nThese molds, and the Gordon version, were focused on ergonomic and reliability testing, and several large changes were made to the controller's design as a result of the testing we conducted with this prototype.\n\n"

		"ValveLobby_TF2HallTitle"	"Saxton Hale"
		"ValveLobby_TF2HallDesc"	"The most complex character we've ever created that still hasn't appeared in an actual game, Saxton Hale is a reminder of how our creative process is influenced by the ongoing conversation between our products and our community. \n\nSaxton began as a simple sketch on a TF2 web page, but the community's instant response to him caused us to flesh him out further, incorporating many of the details that the community suggested or responded to most. \n\nOver time, the community's Saxton Hale fan art, fiction, and even playable game modes have all affected the ongoing process of expanding Saxton's design, and his role in the TF2 universe.\n\n"

		"ValveLobby_TrophiesTitle"	"Trophies"
		"ValveLobby_TrophiesDesc"	"We've been lucky enough to be awarded for a variety of things over the years, but the awards that mean to the most to us are ones given by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, because they're voted on by our peers in the games industry. \n\nReceiving this first Half-Life 1 Game of the Year award from the AIAS was really an unforgettable moment for us, beyond any of our hopes when we started working on it.\n"
			
		"ValveLobby_ValveLogoTitle"	"Valve Sign"
		"ValveLobby_ValveLogoDesc"	"This sign was cut with a high pressure water jet, after a laser cutter had failed to create smooth enough edging. The symbols, icons, and logos you see here were taken from our various games in 2010 when we moved into this office space. \n\nThe images were positioned using a simple image packing algorithm which we wrote specifically to create the sign. Each of the individual symbols is repeated within the sign multiple times, except for a single Gordon Freeman, who's hidden as an exercise for the viewer.\n\n"

		"ValveLobby_HL2PCTitle"	"HL2 PC Fan Art"
		"ValveLobby_HL2PCDesc"	"Fans create amazing things related to our games, and often we see one that we like so much that we decide we'd like to have one of our very own. In those cases, we contact the original creators and pay them to make us one. \n\nThis Half-Life 2 themed PC case mod was created by Piloux, who came to our attention when he built a spectacular Black Mesa themed case mod a few years earlier.\n\n"

		"ValveLobby_MagazinesTitle"	"Magazines"
		"ValveLobby_MagazinesDesc"	"This section of PC games magazines often reminds us of how our relationship with our customers has changed. In 1998, when we released Half-Life 1, fighting for the PC Gamer front cover was an all consuming goal, because it was critical to many customers knowing our game existed. \n\nToday, the internet provides a way to conduct our conversation with our customers in a much more robust way, but that doesn't stop us from being a bit nostalgic when we see these early images of Gordon Freeman.\n\n"
		
		"ValveLobby_CSMagazinesTitle"	"Counter-Strike"
		"ValveLobby_CSMagazinesDesc"	"Counter-Strike is such an enormous community today, with players in every corner of the world, it's easy to forget that it began as just one of many Half-Life 1 mods. After shipping Half-Life 1 we spent years trying to improve it as a mod platform, working directly with many mod-makers to ensure they had the capabilities they needed to realise the visions they had in their heads. \n\nIn some cases, as with Counter-Strike, we found the mod-makers were so smart we needed to learn everything we could from them, and the best way to do that was to bring them fully into Valve itself.\n\n"		



		"LaPedrera_IntroTitle" "La Pedrera"
		"LaPedrera_IntroDesc" "You are standing in the courtyard of Casa Milà, popularly known as ‘La Pedrera’ in Barcelona, Spain. Designed by Antoni Gaudí, La Padrera was completed in 1912. \n\nThis photogrammetric recreation was captured by a Valve employee on holiday in 2016."

		"LaPedrera_FacadeTitle" "La Pedrera Facade"
		"LaPedrera_FacadeDesc" "The name La Pedrera (the stone quarry) comes from the resemblance of its facade to an open quarry. The facade itself is constructed of large blocks of limestone, and is self-supporting. \n\nBecause the facade is free of the functions of a load-bearing wall, it is possible to create large openings which give light to the homes without affecting the stability of the building."

		"LaPedrera_GarageTitle" "La Pedrera Garage"
		"LaPedrera_GarageDesc" "When it was built, La Pedrera included an underground garage - the first of its kind in Barcelona. During construction Gaudi even agreed to remove a pillar from the building's design so a wealthy neighbor could access the garage with his Rolls Royce.\n\nThe garage is now an auditorium, which is used for holding symposiums and events."
		
		"LaPedrera_CourtyardTitle" "La Pedrera Courtyard"
		"LaPedrera_CourtyardDesc" "La Pedrera’s courtyard performs an essential function as the internal core of the building. It allows light and air to come into the living spaces, and serves as a secondary facade for the residents. \n\nThe entryway features paintings of mythology and flowers in oil on plaster. Access is protected by a massive iron gate designed to allow light and air into the building."
		
		"TowerBridge_OverviewTitle" "Tower Bridge, London"
		"TowerBridge_OverviewDesc" "This iconic bridge crosses the River Thames just east of the Tower of London. Opened in 1894, its central bascule sections can be raised to allow tall ships to pass through.\n\nThe photogrammetric recreation you are standing in was captured in September 2016."
		
		"TowerBridge_ThamesTitle" "The River Thames"
		"TowerBridge_ThamesDesc" "This part of the River Thames is known as the Tideway. Due to its proximity to the North Sea, the river level varies by up to seven metres between low and high tides.\n\nWere you actually here, the gravelly area beneath your feet would be fully immersed just a few hours from now."
		
		"TowerBridge_MudlarksTitle" "London Archaeology"
		"TowerBridge_MudlarksDesc" "Founded by Romans around 2000 years ago, London has an immense archaeological record.\n\nToday, people known as 'mudlarks' scour the banks of the Thames in search of old items of interest - Roman coins, Victorian clay pipes, ancient swords, WW2 munitions, and even a prehistoric wooly rhinoceros skull were recently found near London Bridge."
		
		"TowerBridge_WildlifeTitle" "Wildlife on the Thames"
		"TowerBridge_WildlifeDesc" "Significantly cleaner than it has been in London's recent industrial past, the river's local fauna includes numerous species of bird and various fish including salmon. Even large aquatic mammals such as seals, dolphins and porpoises can be found in this tidal region.\n\nThough marine life is thriving, this environment is still fragile and at risk from human activity."
